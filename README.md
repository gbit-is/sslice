# About
I did some research on the SSL usage of .is domains and I [wrote a blog about it](https://biomech.xyz/2018/04/03/iceland-and-https/).

I wrote the blog about a dataset I gathered from checking 17.4K .is URLs. After gathering the data for it I recieved 2 additional URL lists that increased my URL list to 53K. Out of those 53K, 27,5K didn't answer http requests and 43K didn't answer https requests.

After running the larger set I did a quick look and the statistics I gathered presented in the blog scaled-ish. so I see no need to modify the blog itself. However I had some requests to publish the raw data. Which is the purpose of this repo
